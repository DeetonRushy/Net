This is supposed to turn a string formatted like this:
into a INetMessage

'rejected?reason=failure&iiwr=true'

Should translate to

INetMessage
{
  "EventId": 'rejected',
  "WantsResponse": true,
  "Properties": {
     "reason": "failure"
  }
}

The reason for this, is to allow users (from a console/GUI standpoint) to send requests
to the client/server with this format.

----- Post Write ------

Works perfectly.

The format is as follows
  EventId        <- the event to raise
    ?            <- tells the lexer there is an argument list.
  PropertyName   <- defines the name of a property
    =            <- assignment of a property
  PropertyValue  <- the value being assigned to the previous property name
    &            <- tells the lexer there is another property
  PropertyName2  <- define another property name
    =            <- assign the second property
  PropertyValue2 <- value of the second property
  <...>          <- go on and on

string literals are now supported for property values.
Ex: "help?index='Manual Page'"

'on-ready?id=9wdkfw832&iiwr=true'

--- Special Parameters (prefixed by 'ii'. Why? because its ugly. No-one would name a parameter this.) ---
'iiwr' - WantsResponse. This will set the 'WantsResponse' property of INetMessage to the
specified value.
