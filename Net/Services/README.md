# Services

This should contain pre-made services that make ease-of-use the main priority.
These services must be a single class that can be easily instatiated.
If they become a ball-ache to setup, provide a helper in Net.Factory

## Things I'd like to make/be made

 - [ ] Filesystem layout helper. (lets you use builder notation to build a directory layout)
 - [ ] Plugin loader (load external DLL's that contain definitions for [T: ProvidedType])
